# Foodify
A c++ application similar to foodpanda. The only difference is it is build on terminal and cpp. Else it contains approximately all features that you can benefit from foodpanda. Such as :
1. Signup
2. SignIn
3. Food recommendation through deep learning
4. food ordering
5. managing cart (items you select)
6. Many data structures and OOP concepts implemented.

and much more.

*This was build by me, Hassan Raza, and Hamza Usmani in our 3rd semester DS project at FAST NU.
